# Solana Validator Statement

## Security

My Solana validator is running on a bare metal server built with love using top-end hardware. I employ all common Linux security features and software, including, but not limited to, a secure kernel and software updates and SSH keys for connections.

In most cases, I use the original open-source software from the official Solana Labs GitHub page (https://github.com/solana-labs/solana).

## Funds and Rewards

All user-staked funds are fully protected by the Solana protocol. The validator does not have access to user-staked funds and rewards, which increase the user's stake every epoch.

## Validator Commission

My commission is 10%. All calculations are automatically handled by the Solana protocol.

## Why Gist and Not a Website?

Using Gist provides users with transparent information about all changes, along with their dates, in this statement. I have no way to modify this document retroactively. You can review all changes by utilizing the Revisions feature on this page. You can also subscribe to receive notifications about any future changes via email.

## Contacts
 
You can find me on the official Solana Tech Discord (https://solana.com/discord) as peter#0991.
